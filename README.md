# vimrc
Vim configuration and also my bash config file to never lose again aliases etc

This is just a mess configuration to make vim work with plugins without a plugin installer that works sometimes. 

Actually I don't remember what dir makes vim plugins work, so I created this repo.

To update neovim add this: 
  - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable
